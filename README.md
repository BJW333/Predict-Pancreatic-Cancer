Predict Pancreatic Cancer
-------------------------------

This repository provides two distinct Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to predict pancreatic cancer diagnoses using urinary biomarker data. Each notebook employs a different approach in regards to its model, showcasing different approaches to the same problem. 
<br>
The patients are classified into three categories of diagnosis classes they are defined as:

	1: Control (No Pancreatic Disease)
 	
	2: Benign Hepatobiliary Disease (including chronic pancreatitis)
 	
	3: Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (Pancreatic Cancer)
<br>

Viewing Outputs and Results.
-------------------------------

To see the output/results of the run programs just click into each corresponding jupyter notebook either: 
<br>
GS_Pancreatic_Cancer_Stacked_Ensemble_RF_HGB_LR_Prediction_Model.ipynb or RS_Pancreatic_Cancer_Stacked_Ensemble_RF_HGB_LR_Prediction_Model.ipynb
<br>â€¨
and scroll all the way down to see the outputs/results and all of the visualizations. If you do not see results download the files onto your own system and run them.
